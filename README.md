# vim.help

## Why this project?
While there's plenty of excellent articles, tutorials and books on Vim out there
(and even  more sub-par ones),  the built-in documentation  is still one  of the
best sources to learn about Vim.  Sadly, it's often overlooked by both beginners
and regular users alike.

There already  exists a  mirror of  the doc online,  but it  doesn't do  much to
improve the reading  experience. The goal of **vim.help** is  to make Vim's docs
more pleasant to browse and peruse. Features:
  * üìñ improved readability (nice colorschemes, decent typography, various display options, etc.)
  * üó∫Ô∏è painless navigation (tag links, ToCs, header anchors, etc.)
  * üîç flexible searching powered by [DocSearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/docs/what-is-docsearch)

## About Vim's help
Vim's help is split into two sections: a user manual and a reference manual.

The **user manual**  is a thorough guide meant to  accompany your journey from
novice to Vim  master. The first part  is an introduction to  the basic features
and should be read  in order. The second and third  parts are respectively about
editing text efficiently  and fine-tuning Vim --- their chapters  can be read in
any order. Finally, there's  also a chapter on installing Vim  and getting it to
run properly.

The  **reference  manual**  contains  detailed  descriptions  of  all  available
options, commands,  mappings, etc.,  and isn't  meant to be  read from  start to
finish.
