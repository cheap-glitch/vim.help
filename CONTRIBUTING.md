# Contributing guidelines

1. Please consider opening an issue before submitting any sizable PR.
2. Please try to respect the code style:
    * [smart tabs](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SmartTabs): tablatures for indentation, spaces for presentation
    * block-opening curly quotes on their own lines (expect for objects and CSS blocks)
    * comments and commit messages in the imperative style, with an uppercase letter at the beginning and no full stop at the end
